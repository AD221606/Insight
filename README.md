🌐 Excited to share my latest project – NeuroLearn 🚀
A learning platform built to make education smarter, faster, and more accessible.

💡 Problem
Students often waste hours on long YouTube lectures or scattered resources before realizing the content doesn’t meet their needs. On top of that, doubts, note management, and productivity tracking remain disconnected.

✨ Solution: NeuroLearn
An AI-powered website designed to tackle these challenges by integrating smart tools for learners:

🔹 AI Video Recommender – Get the best YouTube videos by link or topic, tailored to your level and time.
🔹 Subject-Specific Chatbots – Ask doubts (even upload images) in Math, Physics, Chemistry, and more.
🔹 Learning Path Generator – Create editable, step-by-step paths for topics like Machine Learning Basics.
🔹 Notes Summariser & Maker – Upload notes and chat directly within them.
🔹 Techniques & Timers – Apply study methods (Pomodoro, Flowtime, etc.) with built-in timers.
🔹 Progress Tracker – Track your personal learning journey from the homepage.

⚙️ Stack & Tools
